# integration-taplytics
Taplytics Javascript integration for mParticle

# Installation

Since Taplytics is an A/B Testing Platform, you might encounter bugs with flickering when using our code variables to change visual components. 

To prevent this, you can install our Taplytics JS SDK directly at the top of your `<head>` tag by following the instructions here: https://github.com/taplytics/taplytics-js-sdk/blob/master/START.md. 

The mParticle-Taplytics integration will automatically detect that you started Taplytics and will prevent any flickering of visual changes on your website!
